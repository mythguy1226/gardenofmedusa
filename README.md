### Game Summary
Deep inside the stone gardens of Medusa, you play as an archeologist. You’ve found yourself thrown into the maze of stone while exploring an abandoned temple in Greece. It is up to you to escape the winding and ever-changing labyrinth while avoiding being the Gorgon’s next victim as another piece in her garden. You must avoid her snake vassals to avoid notifying Medusa of your presence. Successfully navigate the garden’s unique traps, snakes, and Medusa’s gaze on your course to the exit, or become one with the garden for eternity.
